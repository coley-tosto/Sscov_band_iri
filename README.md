# Analysis of band iridescence in *Syngnathus scovelli*

This repository documents the analysis of iridescence bands located primarily on female Gulf pipefish, *Syngnathus scovelli*. Iridescence was measured using the Iridescence Detection and Isolation Algorithm (IDIA) and the goals of this study are to:

1. Test the reliability and repeatability of iridescence measurements from the IDIA
2. Determine wether the IDIA could be used to detect geographic variaiton in the iridescent signal on females
3. Investigae the use of the IDIA to measure the development of iridescence on males as a response to exposure to synthetic estrogen
